# Backend Action Plan: ExpressJS + TypeScript

## Learning Goals & Approach

**Primary Goal**: Learn backend development from scratch
**Experience Level**: Software Engineer with 2-3 years of experience
**Learning Philosophy**: Understand core concepts first, then scale up gradually
**AI Role**: Guide and explain concepts rather than providing complete solutions

## Current Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 4 - Docker & Containerization ✅ COMPLETED
**Last Updated**: October 2024
**Project**: Full ExpressJS Todo App

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation (Days 1–7) ✅ COMPLETED

-   Set up project structure (controllers, models, routes, services)
-   Understand routing and route handlers
-   Implement controllers using class-based OOP style
-   Define TypeScript interfaces for Post model and API types
-   Add endpoints: GET /posts, GET /posts/:id, POST /posts
-   Add error handling and logging (e.g., with Morgan)

**What was learned**: Basic Express.js structure, TypeScript interfaces, routing concepts, controller patterns

### Phase 2: Persistence with MongoDB (Week 2) ✅ COMPLETED

-   ✅ Connect to MongoDB using Mongoose
-   ✅ Create schemas and models
-   ✅ Refactor controllers to use database
-   ✅ Add PUT and DELETE endpoints
-   ✅ Store DB credentials in .env

**What was learned**: MongoDB connection, Mongoose schemas, CRUD operations, database validation
**Next Phase**: Docker & Containerization

### Phase 3: Auth and Security (Weeks 3–4) ✅ COMPLETED

-   ✅ Create user model and auth routes
-   ✅ Implement JWT login and register
-   ✅ Hash passwords with bcrypt
-   ✅ Protect routes using middleware
-   ✅ Add role-based access control (optional)

**What was learned**: JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, middleware patterns, route protection, error handling
**Next Phase**: Deployment

### Phase 4: Dockerize the App (Weeks 4–5) ✅ COMPLETED

-   ✅ Write Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
-   ✅ Containerize MongoDB and the app
-   ✅ Create .env.docker for environment config
-   ✅ Test container setup locally
-   ✅ Implement hybrid development workflow (local app + Docker DB)
-   ✅ Create comprehensive Makefile for Docker commands

**What was learned**: Docker containerization, docker-compose orchestration, Docker networking, port mapping, volume persistence, hybrid development workflows, Makefile automation
**Next Phase**: Deployment + Remote DB

### Phase 5: Deployment + Remote DB (Week 6–7)

-   Connect to MongoDB Atlas (remote)
-   Deploy using Render, Railway, or AWS
-   Manage secrets and environment vars
-   Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions

### Phase 6: Advanced Topics (Week 8+)

-   Add unit and integration testing (Jest, Supertest)
-   Implement Redis caching
-   Add pagination, filtering, search
-   Upload files (e.g., to S3 or Cloudinary)
-   Explore microservices and WebSockets

## Weekly Breakdown

-   **Week 1**: Express + TypeScript basics — Working routes, controllers, errors ✅
-   **Week 2**: MongoDB + Mongoose — CRUD with database ✅
-   **Weeks 3–4**: Auth & middleware — Login/register + JWT ✅
-   **Weeks 4–5**: Docker — Fully containerized app ✅
-   **Week 6**: Deployment — Live version of app online
-   **Week 7+**: Advanced features — Production-ready features

## Learning Approach & Guidelines

1. **Concept First**: Understand the "why" before the "how"
2. **Hands-on Practice**: You'll implement solutions with guidance
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Build up gradually as concepts become clear
4. **Question-Driven**: Ask questions to deepen understanding
5. **Mistake Learning**: Embrace errors as learning opportunities

## AI Interaction Guidelines ⚠️ IMPORTANT

**CRITICAL RULE**: This is YOUR learning project - you do the coding!

**What AI Should Do:**

-   ✅ Explain concepts and provide guidance
-   ✅ Show suggestions in the sidebar (code examples)
-   ✅ Help debug issues and explain errors
-   ✅ Answer questions about best practices
-   ✅ Point out potential improvements

**What AI Should NOT Do:**

-   ❌ Write or modify code files directly
-   ❌ Use edit_file, search_replace, or similar tools
-   ❌ Make changes to your codebase
-   ❌ Solve problems for you

**Your Role:**

-   🎯 Implement all code changes yourself
-   🎯 Use AI suggestions as learning material
-   🎯 Ask questions when you need clarification
-   🎯 Experiment and learn from mistakes

**Remember**: The goal is for YOU to learn backend development, not for AI to build the app!

## Current Session Notes

**Date**: October 2024
**Focus**: Phase 4 Docker & Containerization - COMPLETED ✅
**Key Achievements**:

- Built docker-compose.yml for multi-container orchestration (app + MongoDB)
- Implemented hybrid development workflow (local app + Docker DB)
- Created comprehensive Makefile with Docker commands
- Learned Docker networking, port mapping, and volume persistence
- Verified data persistence across container restarts
**Next Session Goals**: Begin Phase 5 - Deployment & MongoDB Atlas
